# PowerBI Railway Challenge: Validating Visuals with SQL queries

## Overview of the Project
This project aims to showcase the skills of the author in creating SQL queries by validating a visualization report from National Railway Company, which is his another project.
The visualization report is primarily concerned on the Sales Performance for the National Railway Company.
Since the author is not yet an expert on PowerBI, he opted to use SQL to countercheck the values being produced by manipulations he performed in PowerBI.

## Data sources
The data source for this project is the dataset that can be downloaded from the Maven Rail Challenge of Maven Analytics. [https://mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-rail-challenge/08941141-d23f-4cc9-93a3-4c25ed06e1c3](url)
